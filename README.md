# conversionr

This is an R package to convert between volume, mass, temperature, and distance units. The package covers converting between basic units of the forementioned categories, and also covers conversions between metric units.

## Installation

Open up an R console. Run the following line:

`install.packages('conversionr')`

## Usage of Conversionr functions
  
  It's very simple to convert units using the `conversionr` package.
  You can easily convert units like temperature, volume, mass, and distance using the functions `conv_temp`, `conv_vol`, `conv_mass`, and `conv_dist` for the most common units. You can also convert in between milli, centi, base, and kilo for the metric system using `conv_metric`. Check the examples below:
  
 If you want to convert 100Â°F to Celsius run the function this way:
 
 `conv_temp(100, "f", "celsius")`
 
 Output:
 
   num    unit

37.774 celsius
 
 
 For volume conversions, the logic is pretty much the same:
 
 `conv_vol(25, "pint", "qt")`
 
 
 Output:
 
  num unit

 12.5   qt
 
 
 The same format follows for mass, and distance:
 
 `conv_mass(1,"lb","oz")`
 
 Output:

  num unit

  16   oz
 
 `conv_dist(4,'feet','m')`
 
 Output:
   
   num...0.3048 unit

   1.2192    m
 
 To convert in between values of the metric system you can do it like so:
 
 `conv_metric(5,"milli","kilo")`
 
Output:

   num unit
    
 5e-06 kilo
